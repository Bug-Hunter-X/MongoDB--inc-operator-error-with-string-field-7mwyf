# MongoDB $inc Operator Error with String Field

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$inc` operator in MongoDB update operations: attempting to increment a field that is of string type. The `$inc` operator is designed to increment numeric fields only, and using it with a string field will result in an error.

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.

## How to reproduce the error

1. Make sure that you have a MongoDB instance running.
2. Create a collection with a document containing a string field that needs to be incremented.
3. Execute the code in `bug.js`.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the field you intend to increment is of numeric type (Integer or Double). If the field currently exists as a string, convert it to a number before performing the increment, or if possible, design the schema so that the field is of the appropriate numeric type initially.
